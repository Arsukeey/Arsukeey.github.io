So. First blog post. Let's get the boring part out of the way, I'm a highschooler that loves tech (I know how generic that sound) living in Brazil.

I started programming when I was 13 years old, when I had my first contact with Linux, with a Raspberry Pi. Then, some time later, I wanted to do some things with GPIO so I introduced myself to Python (which is still my best language). But I still wasn't confident with my programming skills so I started learning C# with the aid of YouTube. And that is when I understood programming logic.

Then, some things happened, and I ended up learning Lisp, Haskell and Rust, which are *by far* my favorite languages right now.

I'm currently using Void Linux, bspwm for Xorg's window manager, neovim for text editing, bing for fetching wallpapers, and using `st` as terminal emulator.

Right now I'm studying IT at Lauro Gomes.

I dislike GNU for various reasons, mainly because they distribute outdated and bloated software. (Yes, I'm a suckless sympathizer.)
