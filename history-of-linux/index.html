<h1 id="the-complete-history-of-linux">The Complete History of Linux</h1>

<h3 id="unix">Unix</h3>

<p>So, to talk about Linux®, we first need to talk about Unix, the operating system
who inspired GNU (And that&rsquo;s what made Linux useful initially).</p>

<p>In 1969, it&rsquo;s development was started. It&rsquo;s intent was to be used by programmers
inside AT&amp;T&rsquo;s labs, and by no means it was meant to be portable.</p>

<p>It was officially announced outside of Bell Labs in 1973.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="gnu">GNU</h2>

<p>GNU&rsquo;s development officially started in 27th September of 1983, when Richard Matthew Stallman sent <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.en.html">this</a> message to the <code>net.unix-wizards</code> newsgroup.</p>

<p>His plan was to make a Unix implementation from scratch, but this time sharing it for free, since he wanted to share his software and he couldn&rsquo;t, because of copyright enforcement by software sellers.</p>

<p>He wanted to create a kernel, user tools, editor, compiler, etc. All from scratch and with something that would become to be known as a Free Software License, in the future (To be more exact, 1989).</p>

<p>In March 22 of 1987, Richard Stallman (called by as rms hereby) finished writing GCC, the GNU&rsquo;s Compiler Collection. He pushed it to the MIT servers (where he studied), and hoped for the best.</p>

<p>By 1989, the only major missing component of GNU was the kernel. It&rsquo;s evelopment began in 1990, this time by the name of Hurd. However, Linus Torvalds, a 21-year-old Finnish student, started working on an operating system as a hobby. He got inspiration from MINIX, and when he got the simple things out of the way, he sent <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/msg/b813d52cbc5a044b">this</a> message, sharing his progress on the <code>comp.os.minix</code> newsgroup. In September of 1991, Torvalds finished version 0.01 of Freax (Original name of Linux®, before being renamed by the then-system-administrator of the FTP server of FUNET. Freax is an portmanteau of Free + Freak + UniX).</p>

<p>By 1992, Linux® was capable of running the X Window System, and GNU had a text editor (Emacs), a debugger (gdb), a yacc parser generator (bison), a linker (part of coreutils), an almost completed shell (Bash), a portable optimizing compiler (gcc) and TeX for text formatting.</p>

<p>Then, rms thought he could use Linux® instead of Hurd by now, as a temporary fix (how little he knew). So he asked Torvalds to license it with the GPL, and Torvalds did so.</p>

<pre><code>This kernel is (C) 1991 Linus Torvalds, but all or part of it may be redistributed provided you do the following:

- Full source is available for free.

- Copyright notices must be intact. Small partial excerpts may be copied without bothering with copyrights.

- You may not distribute this for a fee, not even &quot;handling&quot; costs.
</code></pre>

<p>As Linux® was a monolithic kernel, it handled with file systems and memory management altogether. This was the main focus of its criticism, since most kernels in 1991 were microkernels, handling everyting separately. <code>&quot;LINUX is obsolete; LINUX is a monolithic style system, this is a giant step back into the 1970s.&quot;</code></p>

<h2 id="first-linux-distributions">First Linux Distributions</h2>

<p>The very first Linux® distribution was Boot-Root, made by H. J. Lu. It was called so because it was composed of two floppy disks, one named &ldquo;Boot&rdquo; and the other named &ldquo;Root&rdquo;. It contained Linux® version 0.12.</p>

<p>The earliest actual Linux® distribution is Manchester Computing Centre Interim Linux, released in February of 1992.</p>

<p>However, the earliest Linux® distribution available to the public was Yggdrasil Linux/GNU/X, released in December of 1992, which was the first Linux distribution to ship with X Window System working without needing any pre-configuration (adapting itself to the hardware).</p>

<p>Then, in July 17, 1993 Slackware 1.0 was released by Patrick Volkerding!</p>

<h2 id="almost-modern-day-linux-distributions"><em>almost</em> Modern-day Linux® Distributions</h2>

<p>Slackware, together with Debian (released in December of the same year) marked a giant step in the Linux® world.
They both still exist to this day!</p>

<p>Linux 1.0 was released in March of 1994, which was more of psychological step than a technological one.</p>

<p>The first commercial Linux® distribution was SuSE Linux, based on Slackware, making Linux® kind of famous in Germany.</p>

<h2 id="royalties">Royalties</h2>

<p>In August 15 of 1994, William R. Della Croce, Jr. trademarked &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, and wanted 10% of all gain anyone made with the kernel. He didn&rsquo;t even know what Linux was, he just trademarked it in an attempt to make money. This affected SuSE tremendously, since the company was just three college students.</p>

<p>Only by around 1997 Torvalds managed to get the trademark lifted.</p>

<h2 id="for-real-now-modern-day-linux-distributions"><em>for real now</em> Modern-day Linux® Distributions</h2>

<p>Red Hat, Inc. was founded in 1993, and it has since then brought open-source software into the enterprise world. Moreover, in 1994 Marc Ewing releaed Red Hat Enterprise Linux®.</p>

<p>Canonical Ltd. was founded in March of 2004, and has brought with it the most popular Linux® distribution, Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m talking about the modern Linux® distributions, I&rsquo;ll also talk about Arch Linux, Void Linux and NixOS, which are my favorite Linux® distributions, currently.</p>

<h3 id="arch-linux">Arch Linux</h3>

<p>Arch Linux follows the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle by design. It tries to focus in elegance, minimalism and simplicity. It was inspired by CRUX, another minimalist distribution, that Judd Vinet started the Arch Linux project. He chose the word because of the word &ldquo;arch-enemy&rdquo;. Vinet led the project until 1st of October of 2007, when he stepped down to name Aaron Griffin as the project&rsquo;s new leader.</p>

<pre><code>Relying on complex tools to manage and build your system is going to hurt the end users. [...] 
&quot;If you try to hide the complexity of the system, you'll end up with a more complex system&quot;. 
Layers of abstraction that serve to hide internals are never a good thing. 
Instead, the internals should be designed in a way such that they NEED no hiding.
- Aaron Griffin
</code></pre>

<h3 id="void-linux">Void Linux</h3>

<p>Void Linux is an independent Linux® distribution that uses the X Binary Package System, and uses the runit init system.</p>

<p>It was created in 2008 by Juan Romero, a former NetBSD maintainer, who wanted to test out his new package manager, XBPS.</p>

<p>Void Linux allows you to use musl instead of the more common glibc, allowing Void to be used in embedded systems. It also is the first Linux® distribution to use LibreSSL as the system crypto library by default.</p>

<h3 id="nixos-and-how-it-revolutionized-package-managament-systems">NixOS, and how it revolutionized package managament systems</h3>

<p>Nix, NixOS&rsquo; package manager, utilizes a purely functional approach to how software is installed. It ensures every package installed through it is in it&rsquo;s own unique directory together with it&rsquo;s dependencies, generated through a cryptographic hash.</p>

<p>This system solves the old dependency hell problem in an incredibly elegant way.</p>

<p>NixOS is built on top of the Nix package manager. It started in 2003 as a research project, with the Integrating Software Construction and Software Deployment<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> paper Eelco Dolstra wrote.</p>

<p>One of its features is the declarative system configuration model, using the Nix domain functional build language. You configure the bootloader, configuration files, kernel and so on by using said language. e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>{
  boot.loader.grub.device = &quot;/dev/sda&quot;;
  fileSystems.&quot;/&quot;.device = &quot;/dev/sda1&quot;;
  services.sshd.enable = true;
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="atomic-upgrades">Atomic Upgrades</h4>

<p>It also uses an atomic approach to upgrading. This means that if the upgrade to a new configuration is interrupted, for example, the power fails half-way through, the system will still boot fine. In other systems, the machine might end up in an inconsistent state, and may not even be able to boot anymore. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>
