This is a short introduction to functional programming using Elixir for examples, but you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know Elixir to understand them. History So, functional programming. It started in 1958 with Lisp by John McCarthy, it is a programming paradigm that&amp;rsquo;s gaining a lot of traction recently, since it makes programs more readable and easier to maintain, since it tries to treat computations as mathematical functions, causing no side effects.</description>

This is my shot at explaining monads. If I say something that&amp;rsquo;s not true, I encourage to send me an email correcting me.
Monads are objects that may or may not return a value. Putting it in simple terms, monads means something can return either a value or nothing, or an arbitrary number of values.
For example, using JavaScript:
function monad(x) { if (x &amp;gt; 5) { return x; } return null; }  monad() can return null or x, depending on the argument it receives.</description>

So. First blog post. Let&amp;rsquo;s get the boring part out of the way, I&amp;rsquo;m a highschooler that loves tech (I know how generic that sound) living in Brazil.
I started programming when I was 13 years old, when I had my first contact with Linux, with a Raspberry Pi. Then, some time later, I wanted to do some things with GPIO so I introduced myself to Python (which is still my best language).</description>
