<h2 id="this-is-a-short-introduction-to-functional-programming-using-elixir-for-examples-but-you-don-t-need-to-know-elixir-to-understand-them">This is a short introduction to functional programming using Elixir for examples, but you don&rsquo;t need to know Elixir to understand them.</h2>

<hr />

<h3 id="history">History</h3>

<p>So, functional programming. Started in 1958 with Lisp by John McCarthy, it is a
programming paradigm that&rsquo;s gaining a lot of traction recently, since it makes programs more readable and easier to
maintain, since it tries to treat computations as mathematical functions, causing no side effects.</p>

<p>Lisp was <em>extremely</em> important to AI development, and we probably wouldn&rsquo;t be here if
Lisp didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<h4 id="lambda-calculus">Lambda Calculus</h4>

<p>The bread and butter of FP<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> is Lambda Calculus. It was invented by Alonzo
Church in 1930, and it consists of functions represented as black-boxes.</p>

<p>An example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-elixir">fn x -&gt; x * x end # Squares argument
</code></pre>

<p>This concept, normally called closures or anonymous functions in other
programming languages, is the core of FP.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="map-filter-and-reduce">Map, filter and reduce</h3>

<p>Those are famous functions, implemented in almost every programming language
(just like Lambda Calculus), and they apply transformations to arrays or lists.</p>

<h4 id="map-applies-a-function-in-every-element-of-a-list">Map - applies a function in every element of a list.</h4>

<pre><code class="language-elixir">Enum.map([1, 2, 3], fn x -&gt; x * x end) # returns [1, 4, 9]
</code></pre>

<h4 id="filter-returns-a-list-of-every-element-that-according-to-the-given-function-is-true">Filter - returns a list of every element that, according to the given function, is true</h4>

<pre><code class="language-elixir">Enum.filter([1, 2, 3, 4], fn x -&gt; if rem(x, 2) == 0 do x end) # Returns only even numbers, [2, 4]
</code></pre>

<h4 id="reduce-transforms-a-list-in-a-single-value">Reduce - transforms a list in a single value.</h4>

<pre><code class="language-elixir">Enum.reduce([5, 10, 15, 20, 25], fn x, acc -&gt; x + acc end) # Returns 75 (every element of the list summed)
</code></pre>

<hr />

<h3 id="immutability">Immutability</h3>

<p>One of the principles of FP is immutability, and that means that variables&rsquo; values don&rsquo;t actually vary.
It is important because it turns functions into predictable black boxes, and as a side effect, the performance
is better, since it doesn&rsquo;t allows copying values around.</p>

<h2 id="https-cs-wellesley-edu-cs110-lectures-l16-images-function-png"><img src="https://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs110/lectures/L16/images/function.png" alt="" /></h2>

<h3 id="first-class-functions">First-class functions</h3>

<p>That means that functions are also treated as values and they can be used as data.
That also means that they can return functions and receive functions as paramenters, making them a lot more powerful.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="higher-order-functions">Higher-order functions</h3>

<p>These are functions that either:
- take functions as arguments, or
- returns a function</p>

<hr />

<p>Combine all that we just talked about, and you get the powerful mix that FP is!
Thank you for reading.
