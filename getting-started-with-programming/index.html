<h2 id="the-struggle">The Struggle</h2>

<p>When you are getting started with programming, you may be confused with which programming language you should learn (even though you are not even sure what those are).</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you some help. <strong>Stop</strong> trying to do that!</p>

<p>You are spending precious time you could be studying or programming!</p>

<p>Just pick whatever language you think you may like.
If you have no idea of which one you should start with, I&rsquo;ll give you some tips.</p>

<p>Reminder: Right now you are looking to learn programming logic, not the ins and outs of the language.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="programming-languages-begginers-can-use-to-learn">Programming languages begginers can use to learn</h4>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Math</strong>. Seriously, this is the most important part. When you are starting to learn the logic behind the magic, math will be your best ally.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Python</strong>. Simple and mature language with a syntax close to english. Good to learn.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>C</strong>. Old language but very, <em>very</em> established. Most of the modern day programming languages have their roots here, and if you think that&rsquo;s not enough reasons, with C you&rsquo;ll learn about how the computer does thing under the hood.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Scheme</strong>. People may not agree with me on this one, but this is <em>my</em> blog. In my opinion, Scheme is good to learn because it&rsquo;s syntax is almost non-existent. And! You have Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP), which is one of the best Computer Science books there are, to introduce you to Scheme.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h4 id="where-you-can-learn-resources">Where you can learn (resources)</h4>

<p>I personally learned programming by using Sololearn (I&rsquo;m not getting paid to write this) and I think it&rsquo;s an awesome platform. If you dislike it, you can always read a book! There are lots of them. <del>And you don&rsquo;t need to pay for them, since you have zlib.</del></p>

<p>Some good books I&rsquo;d recommend are:</p>

<ul>
<li>SICP (as I said before)</li>
<li>The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition // After you finish this, Modern C</li>
<li>The Little Schemer</li>
<li>The Practice of Programming</li>
<li>Code Complete</li>
<li>Clean Code</li>
<li>The Pragmatic Programmer</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Now, you&rsquo;ll need a workspace to learn it. For hardware, mostly anything works. But everything will be easier for you if you install a Linux distribution and a text editor/IDE. Most people like to use Sublime Text or VS Code to edit text, but you can use whatever works for you. (If you care, I&rsquo;ve been using neovim, and I plan to write about it on the future)</p>

<h1 id="what-next">What next?</h1>

<p>Ok, so you now know the basics of programming. Good! My sincere congratulations.</p>

<p>Now, learn about</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>HTML/CSS/JS</strong>. The meat and bones of the web. Since the web is the ultimate GUI application, you need to learn this.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Concurrency</strong>. Learn how to make asynchronous programs.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Git</strong>. Contribute and learn to open-source projects.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Java/Swift</strong>. You will use Java to build Android mobile applications, and Swift for iOS apps.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Functional programming</strong>. Learn Haskell, Lisp dialects and Erlang/Elixir. Seriously, you will be a better programmer, you will think more mathematically and if you get the concepts right, you will build safer applications.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>C++</strong>. This one will teach you Object Oriented Programming, which (sadly) is still a strong skill on the job market these days. After you are good with C++, learn Rust. <em>&ldquo;Rust is like 5 languages combined, but instead of ending up like like 5 kids in a trenchcoat, it ends up like the power rangers&rdquo;</em> Rust has all the good features of C++ but without the boring part.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Networking</strong>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Node.js, npm and React</strong></p></li>
</ul>
